## Organization of the website

Our web application is meant to serve as a one-stop-shop for purchasing ramen online. We divide our application into the functionalities that pertain to three different personas:

  1. Customers
  2. Critics
  3. Brands
  
### Customers

Customers have three screens: a home screen, a screen for viewing a specific product, and a cart screen

A customer's home screen displays their name, their favorite products, and their recently ordered products.

The screen for viewing a specific product displays the product's name, spice level, average rating, and other details about the product like noodle and broth type. It also has buttons to add a quantity of the product to the cart, navigate the cart, and add the product to the customer's favorites list. The screen also shows the reviews of the product.

A customer's cart shows the cart associated with their user ID. It also has a button for purchasing all the items in the cart.

### Critics

Critics have two screens: a home screen, and a screen for writing a review for a product.

The first screen shows the critic's name, a table of all their past reviews, and a table of the reviews in which they gave the highest ratings.

### Brands

Brands have one screenâ€“ a home screen. It shows brand statistics:
- total profit
- average rating
- highest selling products
- locations where their products are popular
- best rated products
